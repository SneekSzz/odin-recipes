    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>Ramen is a beloved Japanese noodle soup known for its rich flavors and diverse ingredients. At its heart, ramen features springy wheat noodles immersed in a savory broth, often made from a combination of meat or fish stock, soy sauce, miso, or salt. This broth serves as the foundation of ramen's taste profile, which can range from hearty and pork-based tonkotsu to clear and delicate shoyu broths. The noodles themselves vary in thickness and texture, adding a distinct chewiness that complements the broth's depth.
    What sets ramen apart are its toppings, which can include tender slices of chashu pork, soft-boiled eggs with custard-like yolks, crisp bamboo shoots, nori seaweed, and green onions. Each bowl of ramen is carefully crafted to balance these elements, resulting in a comforting and satisfying meal that has captivated food enthusiasts worldwide. Whether enjoyed in a bustling ramen shop or homemade with meticulous care, ramen continues to evolve while remaining a cultural icon of Japanese cuisine.</p>
